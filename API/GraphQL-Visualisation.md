# GraphQL Schema Visualisation

If a GraphQL API allows introspection you can use [GraphQL Voyager](https://ivangoncharov.github.io/graphql-voyager/) to display all objects and their types in a graph.  

Navigate to the link above and click on "Change Schema".  
Click the "Introspection" tab and copy the introspection query.  
Send the query to the in scope application and paste the response into the GraphQL Voyager input box. Then click "Display".
